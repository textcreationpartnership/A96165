            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">And Tendred to the Serious Conſideration of all who are willing to be Inform'd <hi>How it became Unhappy,</hi> and how it may yet be made Happy again to Poſterity.</head>
            <p>WHETHER the Majority of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ever true, or the Majority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ever falſe to the Crown of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the moſt Conſiderable of the ſaid Majority of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> are not at preſent better Subjects to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> than either to King <hi>William,</hi> or the late King <hi>James,</hi> which is made evident, in that ſo many of them choſe rather to be Slaves in <hi>France,</hi> than Free-born Subjects in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and loſt their Eſtates, and left their Relations, with their Native Countrey, and much of their rich Plunder they got from the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than live under King <hi>William</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Whether one of a hundred of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was an Enemy to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or one of ten thouſand of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> a Friend to it?</p>
            <p>Whether the Degenerate <hi>Iriſh</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction, be not more Jeſuited, Frenchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and more inveterate againſt the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> than the Ancient <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and needs not a much more Circumſpect Eye of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them?</p>
            <p>Whether in all Ages there hath not been obſerved a greater aptitude in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> to turn <hi>Iriſh,</hi> than in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to become <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Succeſſors of the degenerate Poſterity of many <hi>Britiſh</hi> Families, whoſe Anceſtors got Eſtates for their fidelity to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> have not as deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt them in the two laſt Rebellions?</p>
            <p>Whether any one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> reſtored, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Proviſoes in the <hi>Act of Settlement and Explanation,</hi> or decreed innocent in the <hi>Court of Claims,</hi> They, or their Poſterity, were not now again in Rebellion? And whether any one Inſtance can be given, that any <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> ever expreſt any ſorrow for what he did in this Rebellion? and whether they are not ready to do the like, had they again the like Occaſion?</p>
            <p>Whether all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> real and perſonal Eſtates, can ſatisfy for the Robbery, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Devaſtation, made by them upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in this laſt Rebellion?</p>
            <p>Whether the Reduction of the ſaid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion hath not coſt more than a hundred thouſand <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lives, and more than two hundred thouſand <hi>Iriſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether more than one half of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not at preſent laid waſte by the ſaid Rebellion?</p>
            <p>Whether thoſe Governors who moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually encouraged the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, and diſcouraged the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> were not always cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated as the beſt Governors of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and beſt Servants to the Crown of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> having in all Ages been ſo rebellious to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, and ſo deſtructive to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects, ought to be intruſted with Places of Truſt or Power? and whether the diſabling them from thoſe Imploys, can, or ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, by any Foreign Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, a Perſecution upon account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have not in all Ages grown rich and proſperous under the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Government? and whether there is any poſſibility that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> can be ſo under theirs?</p>
            <p>Whether it is not demonſtrable that the Nocent <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been Millions of Pounds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153747:2"/>Gainers, and the Innocent <hi>Britiſh</hi> as much more Loſers by their two laſt Rebellions?</p>
            <p>Whether what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> uſually loſe by puſillanimity in the Field, they have not as conſtantly recovered by Flattery at Court?</p>
            <p>Whether ever they kept faith in any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles made with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> either in this, or their former Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Whether the Articles made with Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Southwell</hi> and his Party, were not as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made to indemnify thoſe <hi>Britiſh,</hi> as the Articles made by the Lord General <hi>Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> was, to indemnify <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick Iriſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether, notwithſtanding the ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> and his Party, were not impriſoned, tryed, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, and condemned as Traytors; and when they produced the ſaid Articles, were told that Articles of War could not invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Laws of the Land?</p>
            <p>VVhether the ſaid Lord General <hi>Ginkle</hi> did not to his immortal Renown, frequently and publickly declare to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> both at <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick,</hi> That he was a Stranger to the Conſtitution of their Countrey; and that they muſt expect no Articles to be made good, that was contrary to the Law, and not in his power to grant?</p>
            <p>VVhether the Laws of VVar can extend to vacate Acts of Parliament, or are not to be limited to Life, and Perſonal Eſtate in the Place, and not to Real or Perſonal Eſtates elſewhere?</p>
            <p>VVhether the Articles of Peace made in the Year 1648. at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> were not as ſolemn, and more binding, than the <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; yet the ſaid Articles of 1648. were not only accounted of no value by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> as to the <hi>Iriſh</hi>'s Real and Perſonal Eſtates, but were alſo utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and diſallowed by the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and made a Bar of Innocency to any claiming by them, as appears by the <hi>Act of Settlement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhether the <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick Iriſh</hi> capitulating with the ſaid Lord General <hi>Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> to have the ſaid Articles confirmed by King and Parliament, is not a Tacit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, That they knew the ſaid Articles could not anſwer their end without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the King and Parliament?</p>
            <p>VVhether all Perſons who acted in, aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſſiſted and abetted the two laſt Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were not attainted from the 1ſt of <hi>March,</hi> 1640. by Act paſt <hi>decimo ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Caroli Primi,</hi> for endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Papal Authority into the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it is not evident, as well by the Orders of the Supreme Council in their former Rebellion, as by the Acts of their pretended Parliament in this, that nothing ſhort of the Sovereignty of that Kingdom, and the Extirpation of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> will be ever ſatisfactory to that Party?</p>
            <p>Whether the vacating of <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Law, and abrogating all Writs of Error, and all Appeals into <hi>England,</hi> doth not ſufficiently evidence, That the Abſolute Soveraignty of that Kingdom, is the Mark, <hi>whatever has been the Butt,</hi> they aimed as in all their Rebellions.</p>
            <p>Whether their pretended Act of Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and Attainder, does not as evidently prove the Extirpation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> to be the chief Deſign of that Party?</p>
            <p>Whether the ſaid Act of Attainder doth not on the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1688. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Lives and Eſtates, and corrupt the Blood of about Three Thouſand of the chief <hi>Britiſh</hi> Inhabitants of that Kingdom; and wanting other matter, Whether their pretended Crime was not the Aiding, and Aſſiſting the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Invaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England;</hi> when His Majeſty that now is, (whom God for ever Bleſs and Preſerve) made not his Deſcent into <hi>England,</hi> till the 5th of <hi>November</hi> following, and managed that Heroick Deſign with that Privacy, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves well knew, that not one of the Attainted <hi>Britiſh</hi> did know it, or could then contribute any Aſſiſtance to it?</p>
            <p>Whether a parallel Law to this Attaind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the deſtruction of ſo many known Innocent Perſons and their Poſterities, can be found among all the Records of <hi>Jews,</hi> Chriſtians, or Heathens Laws?</p>
            <p>Whether King <hi>James</hi> did not by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Law diveſt himſelf and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of any Power to Pardon or Mitigate any of the Penalties mentioned in the ſaid Act?</p>
            <p>Whether his Father King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1ſt. did not by his Act of <hi>Attainder</hi> made <hi>decimo ſeptimo Caroli Primi,</hi> with more Juſtice and Reaſon attaint all ſuch <hi>Iriſh</hi> as ſhould be aiding or aſſiſting as aforeſaid, to introduce the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> into that Kingdom?</p>
            <p>Whether all the Freeholders of Land, and all the Freemen of Burrough Towns who choſe Repreſentatives to ſit in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council, or pretended Parliament, to introduce or maintain that Authority, are not attainted by that Law?</p>
            <p>Whether by the ſaid Act all the Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that Rebellion were not veſted in the then King for the uſes of the ſaid Act;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153747:2"/>and whether a Moiety of the ſaid Uſes, were ever ſatisfied?</p>
            <p>Whether the King by the ſaid Act did not diveſt himſelf and his Succeſſors of any Power to Pardon any of the aforeſaid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted <hi>Iriſh,</hi> without the conſent of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether any of the ſaid <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, can have any Legal Right to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they enjoyed or poſſeſſed in the Two laſt Reigns; they being never pardoned or reſtored by the conſent of the ſaid Lords and Commons; and none of the ſaid Acts ever yet Repealed or Reverſed, but continue in force to this very day?</p>
            <p>Whether upon Examinations it will not appear that the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> and their Poſterities have but a very weak and imperfect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the ſaid Eſtates by the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Explanation, paſt in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that for theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The ſaid Act of Settlement and Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation does as the Acts of <hi>England,</hi> veſt the Forfeitures in the King for the Uſes therein mentioned, with only this difference. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Act veſts Remainders, which is not in the Veſtiture of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts.</item>
               <item>2. The Enacting Clauſes of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts, raiſes Rents above the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acts, and retrenches one Third what is allowed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acts to the Adventurers.</item>
               <item>3. The Uſes mentioned in the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts, were as the aforeſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acts, never half paid or ſatisfied.</item>
               <item>4. Both the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts declares chief Favour to the Proteſtant Intereſt; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, That none of them ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before reprized with other Lands of equal Value, Worth, and Purchaſe; yet not one of twenty of the Proteſtants have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Benefit by the ſaid Clauſe, but after Ten years Poſſeſſion many were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out without any Reprize for Lands or Improvements, when the ſaid Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were of greater Value than the Lands were worth, when they entred on them; and the while, large Donatives were given by the ſaid Acts to all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals that were then alive, who had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their former Propriety reſtored, but moſt of them had new Honours conferred upon them by the King, and Large Donatives given them by Proviſoes in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts, or were made Innocent by the Decrees of the Court of Claims.</item>
               <item>5. The Acts of Settlement gives a twelve Months time for its Execution, and preſcribes thoſe ſtrict Rules for Adjudication of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, that an Ingenious <hi>Iriſhman</hi> upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſaid Act affirmed, that his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might as well plead Innocency upon the terms of the Decalogue with God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as with his Vicegerent, on the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Innocency by the Act of Settlement; yet however the proof of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nocency being placed on the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made all within their Reach either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their guilt, or ſubject to their wrath, there were few or none left alive to give Evidence againſt them; the Officers and Soldiers who ſerved before the year 1649. having arrears due by the ſaid Acts, were adjudged parties, by the Commiſſioners and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence, being refuſed as <hi>Participes Criminis,</hi> ſo there being but little Evidence left, many times Innocents were made as faſt as Claims were read.</item>
               <item>6. The Commiſſioners for Claims were ſo long delayed, that the twelve Months time allowed by the Act of Settlement was efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed before the Commiſſioners met, which defect was ſupplied by another Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, commonly called an Act of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, which gave the ſaid Commiſſioners ſix Months time for reſtoring of Innocents, and ſix Months more in Caſe the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Council ſhould conſent thereunto; but the ſaid Lord Lieutenant and Council were ſo little ſatisfied in the juſtice of the ſaid Commiſſioners proceedings, that they poſitively refuſed any Enlargement of the ſaid term, however the Commiſſioners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and reſtored ſix times more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, when they had no power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for ſo doing, than they did before.</item>
               <item>7. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Claimants do moſt of them under their Hands and Seals confeſs that they enjoyed their Eſtates Real and Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al till turned out by the Uſurpt power, when it is well known, no <hi>Britiſh</hi> could live in thoſe Quarters, and by the Books of Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Quarters, made by the Ceſſation, it is clear that nine parts in ten of the whole Kingdom was <hi>Iriſh</hi> Quarters.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> under their ſaid Hands and Seals claimed the benefit of the Articles of Peace, made <hi>Anno</hi> 1648, which as well as the former are excluded from any claim of Innocency by the expreſs qualification of the Act of Settlement.</item>

            <p>Were the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Claims, Decrees, Acts of Periods with the Qualifications of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, mentioned in the Act of Settlement. compared together, not one of fifty of the ſaid Decrees wou'd be found Legal, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the ſaid Acts.</p>
            <p>Whether his Majeſty by the Articles of <hi>Galway,</hi> and <hi>Lymerick,</hi> is now obliged to give the <hi>Iriſh</hi> a better or more Legal Title to the Eſtates they enjoyed, and poſſeſſed in the two laſt Reigns?</p>
            <p>Which Right appearing to be none, by the aforeſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and ſo lame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective by the aforeſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts, and the <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick Iriſh</hi> having many of them in perſon, and all of them by their Repreſentatives, made null and void the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Laws, by their pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with that Declaration of Abhorrency and Contempt, that they cauſed both the ſaid Acts publickly to be burnt by the hands of the Common Hangman.</p>

            <p>There being as aforeſaid, difference in the Veſtitures, and the Enacting Clauſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts,</p>
            <p>Whether it may not be a dangerous Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Poſterity, that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould aſſume a power to Alter, Change, Reverſe, or Repeal any Acts or Clauſe of Acts paſt in the Parliament of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the ſitting of a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> continued from 1640 to 1647, whilſt the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> paſt the Laws 17<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Since that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are ſo jarring as aforeſaid, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not contribute much to the improvement, quiet and ſatisfaction of that now deſolate Kingdom, and a good Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to root up thoſe miſchievous Fibres which have conſtantly Repullulated into a forty years Rebellion?</p>
            <p>VVhether it be not deſirable, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will be Graciouſly pleaſed, that one and the ſame Act ſhould paſs both Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſecure the Titles of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and ſuch of the <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick Iriſh</hi> as his Majeſty knows moſt deſerving his favour, and moſt likely to live well and Loyally with the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> and to leave the reſt of that Rebellious Herd, to ſtand or fall by their preſent Titles?</p>
            <p>And whether it is not as deſirable, That His Majeſty would be further graciouſly pleaſed to grant an Act of Regiſtry, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Property againſt Perjury and Forgery; whereby the Ruins of that Kingdom would ſoon be repaired, His Majeſties Revenue highly improved, Trade Encreaſed, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and Vexatious Suits of Law preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and without which <hi>Ickabod</hi> muſt be the Character?
